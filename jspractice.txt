assign a variable to the inputbox

loop through every element by id that is a number
for each number clicked, add the number on to the end of the string.
But if the inputbox is already 0, leave it as 0.

loop through every item that is an operation, then add the operation onto 
the end of the string.
But if the inputbox is 0, then leave it as 0.
what if you have a minus already? if the last element of the string is 
not a number, then do not add the element(pass)
