1. Create a simple login page using only html and css

Criteria:  
The tab on should be named 'Login'.You should be able to type in your initials.  
There should be a visible indication that the button is being hovered over.  
The 'Login' title and the 'Please enter your initials' caption should have unique custom styles.  
If the browser window is resized, the main login card should stay in the center of the screen.  
While there is still space around the main card, scrollbars shouldn't be visible on the edges of the screen.  
All styles should be in a separate css file.  
When the page loads, the form should have some sort of animation or transition effect.  

2. Create a new page that has a basic calculator using html, css & js  
Part 1:  
The page should have 2 inputs in which you can enter numbers.  
There should be a select input that lets you choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  
There should be a p tag that displays the output of the calculation which should update a button is pressed.  
Be sure to account for any possible errors (eg what if a string is given instead of a number).  
Add basic styling for presentation.  
Once this works, add a checkbox next to the button that when checked makes the calculation run whenever the value in either input is changed.  
The button should also be disabled when the button is checked (make visual changes to indicate that the button is disabled).  

Part 2:  
Create an interface similar to the one on the right that can do the same operations.  
You will interact with the calculator by clicking on the buttons rather than typing with the keyboard.  
The 'screen' at the top of the interface should update as you click on keys.  

3. Link the login page to the calculator  
Make changes to the login page such that when you press the submit button, you are redirected to the calculator page.  
Add a ribbon at the top of the page that contains a p tag showing who logged in (this value should change depending on what was entered on the login page).  
The ribbon should also have a logout button that takes you back to the login page. Again add basic styles.  
Create a navigation menu that open when you hover over an icon/div and add a link to the calculator page (since this is the only non-login page you have at this point).  

4. Table generation
Create a new page that has 2 inputs and a button.  
When the button is pressed a table should be generated that has as many rows and columns as specified in the inputs.  
If the input values are changed, pressing the button should destroy the old table and make a new one.  
Account for any possible errors.  
Each cell should be contain its row and column number (eg the top left cell should say 1-1 or 0-0 depending on how you index).  
When any cell is clicked, make an alert that tells you which cell was clicked with a message such as: 'You have clicked the cell in row 5, column 2'.  
Add the link to the table page to the navigation menu. When navigating between pages the current user displayed in the ribbon should stay the same.  
Make sure todays date is in the nav ribbon.
